            <h3>RECALIBRATING NATIONAL SECURITY: PREPARING FOR STATE POLICE, REPOSITIONING PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS, RETHINKING THE ROLE OF THE MILITARY/FEDERAL SECURITY AGENCIES - A MULTI-STAKEHOLDERS' ROUNDTABLE</h3>
            <p>20th - 21st January 2026  Conference Hall, Yakubu Gowon University (UNIABUJA), Airport Road, Abuja (Daily 10AM)</p>
            <p class="them">Theme:</p>
            <p>Preparing for State Police, Repositioning Private Security Guards, Rethinking the Role of the Military/Federal Security Agencies</p>
            <p>On 26th of November 2025, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu signed a release empathizing with victims of insecurity and reassuring Nigerians of his Administration's determination to end the menace of insecurity. Importantly, the president called "on the National Assembly to begin reviewing our laws to allow states that require state police to establish them". This is a laudable and timely intervention that will surely enhance security across the Nigerian federation. This workshop aims to reinforce the president's call by bringing together Nigerian and foreign security experts and professionals to discuss how Nigerian states can harness the opportunities of state policing in the best possible ways. In addition, the workshop shall examine the roles that Private Security Guards can play in boosting security in the states, as well as repositioning the Federal security apparatus in a regime of state policing. This workshop is a vital platform for policymakers and experts to forge an integrated, effective, and accountable multi-stakeholder security model for Nigerian states. We must harmonize the efforts of local law enforcement (State Police), Federal Security Agencies, and non-state actors, particularly, Private Security Guards (PSGs).</p>
